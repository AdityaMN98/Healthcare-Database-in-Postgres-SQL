1. Generated data is used for the project. The data has
been generated and stored as a SQL file. The data was
generated from a website name mockaroo. The file of the
generated data is in SQL format. I have created a table
with all columns and then inserted each data to the table. As
each row in the data is different, I have updated certain
rows of the data in order to show certain functionality of the
database. The data in the table hospital data is shown below.
I have added data_generated.sql file for reference.


2.The create file creates all tables.


3.The load file loads data generated to each table.


4.The query file has all the query we have executed.


Run the files in the same order to get the results.
